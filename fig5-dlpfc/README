Scripts to run BANKSY on the DLPFC dataset from: 

Maynard, K. R. et al. Transcriptome-scale spatial gene expression in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 
Nature Neuroscience 24, 425â€“436. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-00787-0 (Feb. 2021).

BANKSY was run with 11 different seeds, and the median ARI across was computed across the samples for each seed, resulting in one ARI value per seed.
Seed 41 gave the median ARI value across seeds.
